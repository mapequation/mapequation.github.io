To find biogeographical regions that capture the spatial structuring of species, we apply community detection on the bipartite network composed of species linked to grid cells where they occur. Grid cells are indirectly connected through shared species (a). The two bottom grid cells end up in different bioregions because of no shared species. By connecting each ancestral node in a phylogenetic tree to the grid cells where its descendant species occur, weighted by their spatial information, we can form bioregions connected not only by shared species but by shared evolutionary history (b). We can indirectly connect grid cells by their shared ancestry at a selected time (c)-(d) for a more detailed analysis. With a recent time, we can use it to solve fragmented bioregions due to sparse data and make it robust against shifting taxonomic resolutions due to the so-called lumper-splitter problem. We uncover unique bioregions by sweeping the selected integration point back in time."

Identifying and understanding the large-scale biodiversity patterns in
time and space is vital for conservation and addressing fundamental
ecological and evolutionary questions. Network-based methods have proven
useful for simplifying and highlighting important structures in species
distribution data. However, current network-based biogeography approaches
cannot exploit the evolutionary information available in phylogenetic data.
We introduce a method for incorporating evolutionary relationships into
species occurrence networks to produce more biologically informative and
robust bioregions. To keep the bipartite network structure where bioregions
are grid cells indirectly connected through shared species, we incorporate
the phylogenetic tree by connecting ancestral nodes to the grid
cells where their descendant species occur. To incorporate the whole tree
without destroying the spatial signal of narrowly distributed species or
ancestral nodes, we weigh tree nodes by the geographic information they
provide. For a more detailed analysis, we enable integration of the
evolutionary relationships at a specific time in the tree. By sweeping through
the phylogenetic tree in time, our method interpolates between finding
bioregions based only on distributional data and finding spatially segregated
clades, uncovering evolutionarily distinct bioregions at different
time slices. We also introduce a way to segregate the connections between
evolutionary branches at a selected time to enable exploration of overlapping
evolutionarily distinct regions. We have implemented these methods
in Infomap Bioregions, an interactive web application that makes it easy
to explore the possibly hierarchical and fuzzy patterns of biodiversity on
different scales in time and space.
