  caption: "A schematic hypergraph represented with three types of networks. (a) The schematic hypergraph with weighted hyperedges and hyperedge-dependent node weights. Thin borders for weight 1 and thick borders for weight 3. A lazy random walk on the schematic hypergraph represented on: (b) a bipartite network, (c) a unipartite network, and (d) a multilevel network. The colours indicate optimised module assignments, in (d) for hyperedge-similarity walks."

Hypergraphs offer an explicit formalism to describe multibody interactions in complex systems. To connect dynamics and function in systems with these higher-order interactions, network scientists have generalised random-walk models to hypergraphs and studied the multibody effects on flow-based centrality measures. But mapping the large-scale structure of those flows requires effective community detection methods. We derive unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows and explore how they and the underlying random-walk model change the number, size, depth, and overlap of identified multilevel communities. These results help researchers choose the appropriate modelling approach when mapping flows on hypergraphs.
